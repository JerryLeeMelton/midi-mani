# MIDI Mani - Online MIDI Manipulator

MIDI Mani is an online platform for running automated edits to MIDI files.

Currently, the only function available on the platform is the "Humanization" function

MIDI Mani is designed to be as easy and no-nonsense as possible.  Just drag and drop the MIDI file that you'd like to work on into the input box on the page to get started.  

Make edits to the available parameters, then run your edits using the corresponding button. 

When that's done you can preview your edits and then, if you're happy, download the resulting MIDI file for use in a DAW or sequencer.
