# MIDI Mani - Online MIDI Manipulator

MIDI Mani is a web-based application that allows users to perform automated edits on MIDI files. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, it offers a user-friendly interface for musicians and producers to enhance their MIDI sequences.

Currently, the only function available on the platform is the "Humanization" function, which randomizes timing and velocity data to achieve a less robotic feel in your MIDI data.

MIDI Mani is designed to be as easy and no-nonsense as possible. Just drag and drop the MIDI file that you'd like to work on into the input box on the page to get started.

Make edits to the available parameters, then run your edits using the corresponding button.

When that's done you can preview your edits and then, if you're happy, download the resulting MIDI file for use in a DAW or sequencer.
